  #41 Explain Inheritance
</summary>

<br/>

> Defines a parent child relationship. Example: sedan extends car (sedan : car)

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #42 Explain virtual keyword
</summary>

<br/>

> Helps us to define some logic in the parent class which can be overridden in the child class.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #43 What is overriding?
</summary>

<br/>

> Occurs when a subclass or child class provides a specific implementation for a method from the parent class that is virtual.
> BONUS QUESTION: what's the purpose of new keyword
>> New modifier's purpose in a child class is to acknowledge that the virtual method from the base class will be hidden.

<details>

<summary>
  #44 Explain overloading
</summary>

<br/>

> Same method name but different signature in the same class.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #45 Overloading and overriding
</summary>

<br/>

> Overloading: same method name but different signature in the same class.
> Overriding: using virtual keyword in parent and overriding it in the child class to have its own implementation.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #46 What is polymorphism?
</summary>

<br/>

> Ability of an object to act differently under different conditions.
> Example: Object1 is declared as a car, but in next line it will be a sedan and in next line it will be a pickup. This is due to inheritance.

<summary>
  #47 Can polymorphism work without inheritance?
</summary>

<br/>

> No

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #48 Explain static vs dynamic polymorphism
</summary>

<br/>

> Static polymorphism = method overloading
> Dynamic polymorphism = method overriding

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #49 Explain operator overloading
</summary>

<br/>

> Helps to redefine additional functionalities for operators (+, -, *, / etc.)
> You may create your own operator overload by using the operator keyword and implement your own logic.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #50 Why do we need abstract classes?
</summary>

<br/>

> Abstract class is a partially defined parent class
> Normal classes cannot create partially defined parent class
> Usage: use abstract keyword in class and property that's partially defined
