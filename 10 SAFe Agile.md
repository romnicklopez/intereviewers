#3 The Agile Manifesto
</summary>

<br/>

> In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was created to respond to the many challenges of traditional project management, and some lighter-weight and more iterative development methods were developed.
>
>> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>> 
>>> We focus on the people doing the work and on direct communication.
>>> 
>> Working Software over comprehensive documentation
>> 
>>> We focus on building the Solution and getting frequent feedback.
>>> 
>> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
>> 
>>> We work to delight customers by working with them to achieve best results.
>>> 
>> Responding to change over following a plan
>> 
>>> We need to respond to customer needs when they occur to enable success.

#4 Shifting to Agile
</summary>

<br/>

> A shift to Agile will likely redefine what it means for you to be on a team, the length of your work cycles, the frequency of customer feedback, the frequency of releases, and the complexity of newly-released products.
>
> The shift to Agile is not easy because it requires a change in how we think.
>
> Instead of a large group of people working on all the requirements, we could work in small teams that work on smaller things and deliver in a shorter and defined period of time.
>
> With Agile, you have the autonomy to really think about what the team should be working on right now, how it should deliver, and how it might delight customers.
>
> A shift to Agile is not simple, but its powerful.

#5 Traditional ways of working
</summary>

<br/>

> Traditional development works in a series of linear phases and stage-gates, which is often pictured as a cascading waterfall.
>
>> First, define all the requirements
>>
>> Next, do all the design
>>
>> Implement everything
>>
>> Finally, verify it all
>
> Ultimately, quality goes down as they rush through delivery, which is bound to cause issues.
>
</details>

<details>

<summary>
#6 What if they worked in a different way?
</summary>

<br/>

> Developing incrementally in a series of short iterations allows for faster feedback from the Customer and faster value.
>
> Quality is not compromised because every iteration of the product had quality built-in.
>
> In order to ship on time, they simply decide to develop fewer non-essential elements than planned.

</summary>

<br/>

> An Agile Team is a self-organizing, self-managing, cross-functional group of 10 or fewer people.
>
> The size and structure of the team are optimized for communication, interaction, and the ability to deliver value.
> 
</details>

<details>

<summary>
#12 Agile Teams use User Stories to deliver work
</summary>

<br/>

> User Stories are short descriptions of a small piece of desired functionality.
>
> User Stories provide just enough information for both the business and technical people to understand the intent.
>
> User Stories represent a piece of work that can be completed in an iteration, typically a 2-week period of time or less
>
> User Stories are written from the perspective of the customer
>
> User Stories focus on the system benefits to the user, and are focused on value.
>

<details>

<summary>
#14 Using the right Agile tools as you need them
</summary>

<br/>

> Many Agile Teams take items from each method to be truly Agile.
>
> Think of these methods like a set of tools, being Agile means using the right tool for the right solution at the right time.
>

#15 Extreme Programming
</summary>

<br/>

> A way of working, developed by Kent Beck, to help build strong teams, successful products, and ultimately happy Customers.

> Coding
>
>> Teams need to focus on creating the best product or service they can.
>> 
>> It is a team effort, and everyone must rally around the code they produce and use it to deliver value.
>> 
>> This requires constant communication and even having two team members working side-by-side with pair programming.
>> 


> Testing
> 
>> Teams need to constantly verify their solution works as expected and use test results to guide their focus.
>> 
>> Various levels of testing, from system-wide testing to fine-grained functional testing, ensure teams get the exact feedback they need.
>> 
>> Teams need to respect the tests, and each other, so that everyone is producing high-quality solutions.
>> 
 

> Listening
> 
>> Customers need to be regularly involved in the team's work, even sitting with them as they code, to ensure the team understands their needs and can thus create innovative solutions for them.
>> 
>> Listening to customers gives the team a vital source of feedback to ensure they are always building the right thing.
 

> Designing
> 
>> Paying attention to the design of their solution means teams can move faster and be more productive.
>> 
>> Teams should focus on simple solutions that solve the problems of today and avoid trying to resolve the problems of tomorrow.
>> 
>> It can require great courage to trust that the team can solve for these future problems later and that they then may need to destroy the solutions they've built for today.
>>

#17 Why Agile?
</summary>

<br/>

> Businesses recognize the need to change
>
>> When moving fast to try to give customers what they want, it's challenging to deliver on time and maintain high quality
>> 
>> When everyone is already doing the best they can, not accomplishing what they had planned for can lead to frustration within the team.
>>

<summary>
#18 The Need for Agile
</summary>

<br/>

> Previously, we could dedicate a great deal of time to development, but now customers are expecting new products in their hands faster and more frequently than before.
> 
> The problem is, we often feel like we're still in a very old and slow pace. We're still trying to do the work with our old methods, but it's just no progressing enough to satisfy our customers.
> 
> We need an adaptive, customer-centric way of working. We need agile.

#19 Scrum
</summary>

<br/>

> Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products.
> 
> It came from rugby, which refers to a way of getting an out-of-play ball back into play. Compared to product development scrum, they are both reactive and highly collaborative.

#20 Team Agility with Scrum
</summary>

<br/>

> Scrum is an Agile Framework for team collaboration around complex product development.
>
> In Scrum, a small team works in short timeboxes called iterations, which are usually two weeks long.
>
> In the beginning of the iteration, the team has a planning meeting where they agree to the work they can complete in the upcoming iteration.
>
> The work is prioritized in a to-do list called Team Backlog.
>
> The team's Product Owner, the person representing the customer, prioritizes the work for the teams and is there to answer any questions they have. Iteration Planning
>
> Throughout the iteration, the team meets every day to talk about their progress on achieving their iteration goals. Team Sync
>
> At the end of the iteration, the team demonstrates the results to the Product Owner and to other stakeholders to get their feedback. Iteration Review
>
> In the next iteration, the team will adjust their plans based on any feedback they received.
>
> Before starting the next iteration, the team reflects on their work and work processes. They discuss what is working, and how they can improve. Iteration Retrospective
>

#21 Team Backlog
</summary>

<br/>

> It contains everything.
>
> It's a list of desired items, not a commitment

</summary>

<br/>

> The Team Sync is key to learn synchronization and self-organization.
>
> It's timeboxed to 15 minutes and is not a problem-solving or status meeting for management.
>
> Its purpose is to coordinate the team's activities and raise blocking issues and dependencies, many of which will need to be resolved after this meeting.

#29 Kanban
</summary>

<br/>

> Kanban means signboard or signal in Japanese.
> 
> A Kanban board is a visual way to represent work and limit the amount of parallel work, which helps teams improve their workflow and be more efficient.
> 
> On a team Kanban board, each column represents a step in the workflow, and a physical or electronic card represents each story.
> 
> Kanban is based on three main tenets:
>
>> Visualize work
>> 
>> Limit work-in-process
>>
>> Measure performance to improve
>> 
</details>

<details>

<summary>
#30 Visualizing the flow of work
</summary>

<br/>

> The most basic Kanban board captures the most basic workflow and has three columns:
> 
>> To Do
>> 
>>> This Kanban board column shows a prioritized backlog of work that needs to be done. This work isn't pushed but pulled into the Doing column when the team is ready to work on it.
>>> 
>> Doing
>> 
>>> Also known as WIP - work-in-process, this is the work that the team is actively doing. The number of Stories in this column should be limited.
>>> 
>> Done
>> 
>>> This is the work that has been completed.
>>> 
</details>

<details>

<summary>
#31 Features of Kanban
</summary>

<br/>

> Work-in-process
>
>> Teams pay special attention to the work in the system: work they are doing right now or WIP.
>>
>> The more stories in WIP, the slower the work gets done. It signifies that the team members aren't collaborating on work, or team members are multitasking.
>>
>> The fewer the stories in WIP, the more team members are likely working together with a singular focus.
>>
>> By visualizing workflows, the team can identify and remedy bottlenecks, enabling work to be completed quickly and more reliably.
>> 
> The power of cards
> 
>> The visualization gives the team transparency into the status of their work and allows better decision making.
>> 
> Harness flow
> 
>> Some may find their work is more flow-based, where they deliver value through consistent, repeated tasks.
>> 
> Focus, focus, focus
> 
>> Kanban helps teams move work forward by implementing WIP limits where each column on the Kanban board is only allowed a certain number of items in it.
>>
>> If a team wants to have additional work in a column, they cannot push finished work forward in the system. Instead, the team must wait for the workers responsible for the next column to pull the work when there is room in the WIP limit.
>>
>> If a column cannot take more work due to its WIP limit, team members are encouraged to help workers in columns to the right to pull work forward and make space.
>>
>> Rather than starting more work, increasing waste from multitasking, and completing priorities, teams are encouraged to get work completed first.
>>
> Continuous improvement
>
>> Kanban helps teams deliver value as quickly and consistently as possible by measuring the time it takes for a work to move across the board, and how long it stays in each column. Teams can use this data to find better ways of working together and processing their work.
>> 
</details>

<details>

<summary>
#32 Main benefits of Kanban
</summary>

<br/>

> Boards
> 
>> Teams use Kanban boards to visualize their work which leads to increased communication and collaboration among team members.
>> 
> Shared View
> 
> Focus on flow
> 
>> Kanban allows teams to focus on process flow in a more visual manner.
>> 
>> Being able to see the process in action allows teams to identify elements of the process that may have gone unnoticed.
>> 
> Increased visibility
> 
>> Kanban helps teams increase their effectiveness by measuring flow and creating visibility of the work. This makes Kanban a critical tool for CI.

#33 Comparing XP, Scrum and Kanban
</summary>

<br/>

> Agility throughout
> 
>> All three Agile methods seek to deliver value to customers early and often, eliminate wasteful activities, and create healthy teams.

 

> XP
> 
>> XP is a great choice if your team delivers value and has direct access to your customer.
>>
>> A coach can help instill courage in your team to work differently, collaborate with respect, and implement these best practices to the extreme.
>>
>> Examples of teams may include developers building custom or internal solutions.
>> 
 

> Scrum
> 
>> Scrum is a good fit if your team is developing a new product or service that must meet the needs of many customers.
>> 
>> A scrum master will be your team's coach to run scrum events that give the team the autonomy to complete their work while still meeting and making commitments to stakeholders.
>> 
>> Examples of teams may include developers building customer-facing products, hardware teams, and marketing
>> 
 

> Kanban
> 
>> Kanban helps team that does the same activities repeatedly by optimizing their time and value. Such teams may find their work more unpredictable, making it hard for them to plan and commit to an iteration of work from XP or Scrum.
>> 
>> A kanban coach will help a team set appropriate WIP limits and measure team performance to achieve kaizen or continuous improvement.
>> 
>> Examples of teams may include Customer Service, IT Support and HR teams.
