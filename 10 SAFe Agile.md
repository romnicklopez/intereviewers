#4 Shifting to Agile
</summary>

<br/>

> A shift to Agile will likely redefine what it means for you to be on a team, the length of your work cycles, the frequency of customer feedback, the frequency of releases, and the complexity of newly-released products.
>
> The shift to Agile is not easy because it requires a change in how we think.
>
> Instead of a large group of people working on all the requirements, we could work in small teams that work on smaller things and deliver in a shorter and defined period of time.
>
> With Agile, you have the autonomy to really think about what the team should be working on right now, how it should deliver, and how it might delight customers.
>
> A shift to Agile is not simple, but its powerful.

#5 Traditional ways of working
</summary>

<br/>

> Traditional development works in a series of linear phases and stage-gates, which is often pictured as a cascading waterfall.
>
>> First, define all the requirements
>>
>> Next, do all the design
>>
>> Implement everything
>>
>> Finally, verify it all
>
> Ultimately, quality goes down as they rush through delivery, which is bound to cause issues.

#6 What if they worked in a different way?
</summary>

<br/>

> Developing incrementally in a series of short iterations allows for faster feedback from the Customer and faster value.
>
> Quality is not compromised because every iteration of the product had quality built-in.
>
> In order to ship on time, they simply decide to develop fewer non-essential elements than planned.
