#1 Explain normalization
</summary>

<br/>

> A database design technique to remove/avoid redundant data

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#2 How to implement normalization?
</summary>

<br/>

> By splitting tables and using the reference data in the master table.

#4 OLTP vs OLAP
</summary>

<br/>

<summary>
#5 Explain 1st, 2nd and 3rd normal form
</summary>

<br/>

> 1st: a table is in first normal form when the columns have atomic values or does not have repeating groups.
>
>> Example: donâ€™t use full name as a single column, create first, middle and last name columns
>>
> 2nd: first normal form should be satisfied. All non-key columns should be fully dependent on the primary key.
>
> 3rd: all 1st and 2nd normal form should be satisfied. No transient dependency should be present.

<summary>
#6 Primary Key vs Unique Key
</summary>

<br/>

> Similarity: ensures we're not allowing duplicates
>
> Differences
>

<summary>
#7 Char vs Varchar
</summary>

#10 What's the use of index
</summary>

>
> Example: encyclopedia are grouped by letter; this way search is easier

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#12 What are two types of indexes?
</summary>

<br/>

> Clustered index
>
> Non-clustered index

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#13 Clustered vs Non-clustered Index
</summary>

<br/>

> Clustered index - leaf node is pointing to the data directly
>
> Non-clustered index - uses clustered index to locate the data

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#14 Function vs Stored Procedure
</summary>

<br/>

> Goal: functions are for computing values while stored procs act as a mini batch program.
>
> Impact: functions will not make any permanent changes to the environment while stored procs can change the environment.
>
> Actions allowed: functions only allow selects while stored procs allows CRUD
>
> I/O: function should have one input with a return value while stored procs can have zero parameter and can return one or more outputs.
>
> Execution: functions can be called from select/where/call from other stored proc. Stored procs cannot be executed from a select/where or from other functions.

#15 What are triggers and why do you need them?
</summary>

<br/>

> Triggers are logics which can be executed when events like insert, update, delete, etc. happens

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#16 What are types of triggers?
</summary>

<br/>

<details>

<summary>
#19 Explain transactions and how to implement them?

<summary>
#20 What are inner joins?
</summary>

<br/>

> Inner join matches records from both tables
>
> Example: select * from table1 inner join table2 on table1.uniquekey = table2.primarykey

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#21 What are left joins?
</summary>

<br/>

> All data from left table are selected plus matching records from the right table
>
> Example: select * from table1 left join table2 on table1.uniquekey = table2.primarykey

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#22 What are right joins?
</summary>

<br/>

> All data from right table are selected plus matching records from the left table
>
> Example: select * from table1 right join table2 on table1.uniquekey = table2.primarykey

</details>

<details>

<summary>
#23 What are full outer joins?
</summary>

<br/>

> All matching and unmatching records from both left and right tables are selected
>
> Example: select * from table1 full outer join table2 on table1.uniquekey = table2.primarykey

</details>

<summary>
#24 Explain cross join
</summary>

<br/>
