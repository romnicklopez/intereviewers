<summary>#1 Difference between .net and c#</summary>

<br/>

> .Net is a framework and c# is a programming language

> C# is composed of syntaxes, grammars, semantics, etc.

> .Net is collection of libraries and it has runtime

</details>

<details>

<summary>#2 Differentiate between .net framework, .net core and .net 8.0</summary>

<br/>

.Net framework runs only on Windows
.Net Core is cross platform
.Net 8.0 provides a unified experience

Performance: .Net framework is slower compared to .Net core. One of the main reasons are the libraries that were broken down to smaller parts in .net core that allows users to only select those that are needed rather than importing a whole chunk of a library.

CLI (Command Line Interface) Support: .Net Core supports Full CLI while .Net Framework is more IDE based which means more flexibility in .Net Core.

Microservice support: .Net Framework No - .Net Core Yes

Mobile Compatibility: .Net Framework No - .Net Core Xamarin

Packaging: .Net Framework packaged as one big framework while .Net core are delivered via modules using Nuget.

  #3 What is IL (Intermediate Language) Code?
</summary>

<br/>

> Partially compiled code that served as an intermediate language between your .net human readable code to machine language with use of JIT

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #4 What is the use of JIT (Just In Time) Compiler?
</summary>

<br/>

> Compiles Intermediate Language and converts it to Machine Language

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #5 Is it possible to view IL Code?
</summary>

<br/>

> Yes by using disassembler apps

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #6 What is the benefit of compiling in to IL Code?
</summary>

<br/>

> The runtime environment and development environment can be very different so depending on the runtime environment JIT compiles the best optimized code as per that environment.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #7 Does .Net support multiple programming languages?
</summary>

<br/>

> Yes it supports multiple language, C#, VB, JS, TS, etc. but at the end of the day it will still be compiled into IL.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #8 What is CLR or Common Language Runtime?
</summary>

<br/>

> It does a lot of things but two of the most important things are to invoke JIT to compile IL code into native/machine language AND runs your application while ensuring it cleans any unused objects by using garbage collector.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #9 What is managed and unmanaged code?
</summary>

<br/>

> All code that runs under CLR is managed code. C or C++ code that have their own compiler and environment outside CLR are unmanaged code.

</details>

<details>

<summary>
  #10 Explain the importance of Garbage Collector?
</summary>

<br/>

> Garbage Collector is a background process which cleans unused managed resources.
